# ðŸ“¦ Queue and Stack in C++

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim  
To study and implement **Queue** and **Stack** operations in C++ using arrays, and to understand their differences in terms of memory allocation, order of processing, and efficiency.

---

## ðŸ“š Theory  

### Queue  
A **Queue** is a linear data structure that follows the **FIFO (First In, First Out)** principle. The element inserted first is the one removed first.  

- **Front** â†’ points to the first element.  
- **Rear** â†’ points to the last element.  

**Characteristics:**  
- FIFO order  
- Insertion at rear, deletion at front  
- Overflow when full, underflow when empty  

---

### Stack  
A **Stack** is a linear data structure that follows the **LIFO (Last In, First Out)** principle. The element inserted last is the one removed first.  

- **Top** â†’ points to the most recently inserted element.  

**Characteristics:**  
- LIFO order  
- Insertion and deletion at top only  
- Overflow when full, underflow when empty

## ðŸ“‹ Algorithm for Stack

1. **Start**  
2. Initialize `top = -1` and define array `arr[MAX]`.  
3. Display menu with options:  
   - Push  
   - Pop  
   - Display  
   - Exit  

4. **Repeat until Exit chosen:**  
   - Read userâ€™s choice.  

   **Push:**  
   - If `top == MAX - 1` â†’ Overflow.  
   - Else increment `top`, insert element at `arr[top]`.  

   **Pop:**  
   - If `top == -1` â†’ Underflow.  
   - Else print `arr[top]`, decrement `top`.  

   **Display:**  
   - If `top == -1` â†’ Empty.  
   - Else traverse from `top` to `0` and print elements.  

   **Exit:**  
   - Terminate program.  

   **Default:**  
   - Print invalid choice.  

5. **End**

## ðŸš€ Applications  
 
 ### Stack  
- Expression evaluation (postfix, prefix)  
- Function call management (recursion)  
- Undo/Redo in editors  
- Backtracking algorithms  
- Browser history navigation  
- Parsing and compilation  

---

## ðŸ§  Conclusion  

- **Queue** follows FIFO, useful for scheduling and buffering.  
- **Stack** follows LIFO, useful for recursion, parsing, and backtracking.  
- Both structures are fundamental in **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** and form the basis for advanced applications like expression evaluation, graph traversal, and memory management.
